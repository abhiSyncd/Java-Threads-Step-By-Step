# 1 - Need 
   
    To utilize the maximum CPU and increase the performance of java program
    
    - Thread Pool Executor constructor 
      > int corePoolSize,
      > int maximumPoolSize,
      > long keepAliveTime,
      > TimeUnit unit,
      > BlockingQueue workQueue 
 
    - Cached Thread Pool
      > 0
      > Integer.MAX_VALUE,
      > 60L, 
      > TimeUnit.SECONDS,
      > new SynchronousQueue()


    Here,
    Do you see this SynchronousQueue?
    BlockingQueue works on following rules:
    > If fewer than corePoolSize threads are running, the Executor always prefers adding a new thread rather than queuing.
    > If corePoolSize or more threads are running, the Executor always prefers queuing a request rather than adding a new thread.
    > If a request cannot be queued, a new thread is created unless this would exceed maximumPoolSize, in which case, the task will be rejected.

    In the case of high load, at best we will get a thread "starvation" situation, at worst OutOfMemoryError.
    It is better to maintain control and not allow clients to "DDoS/throttle" our service.


# 2 - Thread Pool Size Considerations 

## CPU Bound Tasks

     Tasks which involves mathematical calculations.
     
     CPU Core
     Single Core : CPU will run one thread at a time.
     Quad Core   : normal desktop generally has four cores in a CPU.
     Multi Core  : While a cloud or server may have as many as cores in CPU.
     Multi CPU   : Supercomputers     

## IO Bound Tasks

**Database Calls**
 
    PROBLEM : 
    > A thread is blocked until DB response is returned.
    > The thread pool is limited by the database's connection pool size.
      Does it make any sense to have 1000 running threads in front of a database connection pool with 100 connections?
               
**Service Calls**

    PROBLEM : 
    > A thread is blocked until DB response is returned.
    > The thread pool is limited by the throughput of this service as well.
       
     
     
# 3 - 

**(a)**

    -  CPU Bound Task -> Ideal thread Count  = Number of Available Cores * [ 1 + (wait time/CPU time)]
    -  Io Bound Task  -> Ideal thread Count  = Number of Available Cores * [ 1 + (Wait time/Service time)]
    
    Here :
    Waiting time : Response Time i.e Time spent waiting for IO bound tasks to complete, 
                   say waiting for HTTP response from remote service.
    
    Service time : Time spent being busy, say processing the HTTP response, marshaling/unmarshaling, any other transformations etc. 
    
    But this example is oversimplified. Besides an HTTP connection pool, your application may have requests from JMS and probably a JDBC connection pool.
   

**(b)**

    If you have different classes of tasks it is best practice to use multiple thread pools, so each can be tuned according to its workload.
    In case of multiple thread pools, just add a target CPU utilization parameter to the formula.

    Target CPU utilization [0..1], 1 - means thread pull will keep the processors fully utilized).
    The formula becomes:
    Ideal thread Count = Number of Available Cores * Target CPU utilization * [ 1 + (Wait time / Service time)]
