     - Problem : Creating Deadlock
    
     - Solution
    
**(c) - [Starvation](https://github.com/abhiSyncd/Java-Threads-Step-By-Step/tree/master/5-c-Starvation)**

     - Problem
    
     - Solution 

**(d) - [Livelock](https://github.com/abhiSyncd/Java-Threads-Step-By-Step/tree/master/5-d-Livelocks)** 

**(e) - Memory consistency errors | Visibility Problem** 
    
    Problem : 
    Given 
    >Dual Core Processor 
    >Thread-1 running and having its own Local-Cache in core-1
    >Thread-2 running and having its own Local-Cache in core-2
    >Both Core-1 and Core-2 shares a common-shared-main-memory
    >A variable v1

    Change in v1 by Thread-1 is not visible by Thread-2


    Solution : Make the variable v1 Volatile
  
    - This indicates JVM and Thread 
      That do not cache value of the variable v1 in the local cache and 
      always read it from the common-shared-main-memory 


**(f) - Other** 

    Given : 
    An object that is not thread-safe (say SimpleDateFormat)
    You want to avoid synchronizing access to that object
    Instead, you want to give each thread its own instance of the object.

    Solution : Thread Local 
    The ThreadLocal class is used to create thread local variables,
    which can only be read and written by the same thread. 
    For example, if two threads are accessing code having reference to same threadLocal variable 
    then each thread will not see any modification to threadLocal variable done by other thread

      2 - Advantage
      3 - Use case 
      4 - Why Strings are Immutable in Java

           - Steps 
           - Immutable Class with Mutable Reference




# 5 - More on Thread Safety 

  
    - Immutable objects are by default thread-safe because their state can not be modified once created. 
      Since String is immutable in Java, it's inherently thread-safe.
    
    - Read-only or final variables in Java are also thread-safe in Java.

    - Example of thread-safe class in Java: Vector, Hashtable, ConcurrentHashMap, String, etc.

    - Local variables are also thread-safe because each thread has there own copy and 
      using local variables is a good way to write thread-safe code in Java.

    - Static variables if not synchronized properly become a major cause of thread-safety issues.

# 8 : Residuals : More on Threads
    
   1) Daemon Threads 
      
          The JVM exits when all the running threads are daemon threads. So imagine you're writing a simple game where your main method loops until you decide to quit. 
          And imagine   that at the start of the game, you start a thread that will endlessly poll some website to trigger alerts. 
	  You would like the JVM to exit when you decide to end the game. 
	  You don't want the endless polling to prevent the game from ending. So you make this polling thread a daemon thread.
    

    - Object-level-lock vs Class-Level-Lock vs Singleton
      (a) Object level lock
          When we want to synchronize a non-static-method-or-codeBlock such that 
	  Only one thread will be able to execute the code block ON GIVEN INSTANCE OF THAT CLASS.
	  
      (b) Class Level Lock 
          Prevents multiple threads to enter in synchronized-block in any of ALL AVAILABLE INSTANCES OF THE CLASS on runtime.
          This means if in runtime there are 100 instances of DemoClass, then only one thread will be able to execute demoMethod() in any one of instance at a time, and 
	  all other instances will be locked for other threads.

      (c) Singleton 
          Restricts the instantiation of a class to one object.
	  
          Please note singleton pattern will not apply lock on the object. 
	  For example 2 different threads are sharing the same single object reference and can call the different method on that single object simultaneously.
          To avoid this, we use DOUBLE-CHECK-LOCKING.
