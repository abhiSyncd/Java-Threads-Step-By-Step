# 1 - When to use  
     
      - When a Main-Thread needs to wait for child-threads before starting its work
      
      - Steps Involved
        > Initialize Counter = Number of Child-Threads
        > Start all the Child-Threads
        > Decrement counter : each time One Thread completes its Execution
        > When Counter == 0 
          All Thread have completed its execution
          Now Resume to Main Thread Execution
          
       - Ex) 
         > Operating-System before strting does 1-or-more Preprocessing steps
         
         > Software Before Installing on your computer, does 1-or-more Preprocessing steps such as 
           Calculating Disk Storage 
           Calculating System Requitements etc.
         
         > CAB-SERVICE : Discussed Below

# 2 - Example 

     CountDownLatch : Synchronizer which allows one Thread to wait for one-or-more thread , before processing

     PROBLEM : 
     3 Employees shares a common-cab while leaving for office.
     Driver will drive the cab only when all 3 Employees take their seats in the car 

     SOLUTION : 
     Set CountDownLatch to 3, One for the each Employee.
     Here
     > Child Threads : Employees 
     > Main Thread   : Driver, resumes|Drives the car only when All-Child-Threads (Passengers) arrives
     
#    
      public class Passenger implements Runnable {

      private final CountDownLatch latch;

      public Passenger(CountDownLatch latch) {
        this.latch = latch;
      }

      @Override
      public void run() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " reached.");
        latch.countDown(); 
      }
    }
    
    Here 
    Each Invocation of " latch.countDown()" will reduce count of CountDownLatch by 1
    When count == 0 , Main Thread Resumes

#
     
     public static void main(String[] args) {

      final CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(3);

      Runnable passenger1 = new Passenger(latch);
      Runnable passenger2 = new Passenger(latch);
      Runnable passenger3 = new Passenger(latch);

      Thread pThread1 = new Thread(passenger1,"Thread1");
      Thread pThread2 = new Thread(passenger2,"Thread2");
      Thread pThread3 = new Thread(passenger3,"Thread3");


      pThread1.start();
      pThread2.start();
      pThread3.start();


      try {
         latch.await();
         System.out.println("Main Thread Resumes : All Passenger Boarded,Driver started the car");
      } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
      }

    }
    
    Output : 
    Thread2 reached.
    Thread1 reached.
    Thread3 reached.
    Main Thread Resumes : All Passenger Boarded,Driver started the car
