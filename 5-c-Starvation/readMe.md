    Deadlock and Starvation both are the conditions where the processes requesting for a resource has been delayed for a long|Indefinite time . 
     - Deadlock   : No Threads proceeds for execution, and each waits for shared-resources that have been acquired by the other Threads.
     - Starvation  
        Starvation occurs in priority scheduling algorithm. 
        Thread Priority can either be given by JVM while creating the thread or it can be given by programmer explicitly.
        
        In priority scheduling algorithm, Higher-priority-Threads is always allocated the shared-resource.
        This prevents the lower-priority-threads from getting the shared-resource and they "starves to death"
